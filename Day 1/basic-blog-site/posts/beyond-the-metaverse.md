While the metaverse hype cools, augmented and virtual reality technologies are making tangible impacts across industries. Here's how AR/VR is evolving in 2024:

## 1. Lightweight Enterprise-Grade Headsets
- **Apple Vision Pro 2**: 40% lighter design with 8K micro-OLED displays
- **Meta Quest 4**: $299 price point with eye-tracking and EMG controls
- **Microsoft HoloLens 3**: Industrial focus with thermal imaging add-ons

## 2. Spatial Computing Goes Mainstream
```swift
// Sample ARKit 2024 code for object recognition
let config = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
config.environmentTexturing = .automatic
arView.session.run(config)

ARAnchor(classification: .industrialMachine).apply { 
    $0.displayMaintenanceHistory() 
}
