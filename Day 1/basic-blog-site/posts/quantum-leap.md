2024 is proving to be a watershed year for quantum computing. As classical computers approach physical limits, these groundbreaking advancements are bringing practical quantum applications closer to reality:

## 1. Error-Corrected Qubits at Scale
- **1,000+ logical qubits** achieved by IBM Quantum System Two
- **72% error reduction** in gate operations using new topological qubit designs
- **Commercial availability** of fault-tolerant quantum processors

## 2. Hybrid Quantum-Classical Supercomputers
- **Integration with exascale systems**:  
  ```python
  # Example hybrid workflow
  quantum_sampler = QuantumProcessor.run(optimization_task)
  classical_ai = Supercomputer.train_model(quantum_sampler.results)
